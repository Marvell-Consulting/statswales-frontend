On the next screen select ‘Update this dataset’.\n\nUsing your [prepared update data table](Data-preparation-‐-Updating-datasets), go through the following steps.\n\n1. Click ‘Data table’ from your dataset tasklist.\n1. Select whether you need to:\n   - add new data only\n   - add new data and revise existing data\n   - revise existing data only\n   - replace all existing data\n1. Upload and check your update data table - if there are any issues with your table, the system will explain the issue and what you need to do to fix it.\n1. Review the updates are correct and confirm the update.\n\n## Metadata\n\nTo update any metadata, click on the relevant section from your dataset tasklist.\n\nIf a dataset has stopped being regularly updated, you will need to set the answer to ‘Will this dataset be regularly updated?’ to ‘No’.\n\n<!-- ### Update notes\n\nA task for adding update notes will be in the 'Metadata' section of the tasklist. These notes will appear in the dataset's history section on the StatsWales website. They are required for any update.\n\nIn short, simple sentences explain:\n\n- what has changed with the update\n- why the changes have been made -->\n\n## Publishing\n\n### When the updated dataset should be published\n\nIndicate what date and time the updated dataset should be published. Publication time is 9:30am by default; only change this if a different time is absolutely necessary.\n\n### Translations\n\nIf you change any of the text fields, you’ll need to provide updated translations.\n\n<!-- You’ll need to provide translations for:\n- update notes\n- any text fields you change -->\n\nYou should follow the same process as for [translating a new dataset](Using-SW3---Creating-a-new-dataset#guidance-translations). The only difference is that the exported CSV will have columns for:\n\n- text field name\n- previous text (English)\n- previous text (Welsh)\n<!-- - previous text (English) (not applicable for update notes)\n- previous text (Welsh) (not applicable for update notes) -->\n- new text (English)\n- new text (Welsh)\n\nThe 'previous text' columns will be populated with the most recently published, bilingual entries for these fields. This will aid translators entering the new text in the translated language. They won’t have to retranslate everything if there have only been minor changes to the text.\n","toc",[21],{"_22":23,"_24":25,"_26":27},"text","Using SW3: Updating a dataset","depth",1,"children",[28,32,35],{"_22":29,"_24":30,"_26":31},"Data",2,[],{"_22":33,"_24":30,"_26":34},"Metadata",[],{"_22":36,"_24":30,"_26":37},"Publishing",[38,42],{"_22":39,"_24":40,"_26":41},"When the updated dataset should be published",3,[],{"_22":43,"_24":40,"_26":44},"Translations",[]]
