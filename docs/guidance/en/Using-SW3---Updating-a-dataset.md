# Using SW3 - Updating a dataset

## Data

From your home screen, select the dataset you need to update. On the next screen select ‘Update this dataset’.

Using your [prepared update data table](Data-preparation-‐-Updating-datasets), go through the following steps:

1. Click ‘Data table’ from your dataset overview
1. Select whether you’re adding new data only or replacing all existing data
   - ‘Replacing all existing data’ can include adding new data as well
1. Upload and check your update data table
   - If there are any issues with your table, the system will explain the issue and what you need to do to fix it
1. If you’re replacing existing data, you’ll need to add revision notes explaining in short, simple sentences:
   - what data has been changed
   - why the data has been changed
1. Review the updates are correct and confirm the update

## Metadata

To update any metadata, click on the relevant section from your dataset overview.
If a dataset has stopped being regularly updated, you will need to set the answer to ‘Will this dataset be regularly updated?’ to ‘No’.

## Publishing

### When the updated dataset should be published

Indicate what date and time the updated dataset should be published. Publication time is 9:30am by default; only change this if a different time is absolutely necessary.

### Translations

If you change any of the text fields, you’ll need to provide updated translations. You’ll also need to provide translations if you enter any revision notes.

You should follow the same process as for [translating a new dataset](Using-SW3---Creating-a-new-dataset#guidance-translations). The only difference is that the exported CSV will have columns for:

- Text field name
- Previous text (English) (not applicable for revision notes)
- Previous text (Welsh) (not applicable for revision notes)
- New text (English)
- New text (Welsh)

The previous text columns will be populated with the bilingual entries in the most recently published version of the dataset. This will aid translators entering the new text in the translated language, as they won’t have to retranslate everything if there have only been minor changes to the text.
